# Data Science
Data science is a field that uses scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves using a range of techniques and tools from a variety of fields, such as mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain-specific expertise, to analyze and interpret complex data sets. Data scientists apply these techniques and tools to various types of data, such as big data, small data, and streaming data, to help organizations make better decisions, improve operations, and drive innovation. Data science is a broad field that encompasses a range of roles, including data analysts, data engineers, and machine learning engineers, among others.
