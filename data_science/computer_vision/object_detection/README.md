# Object Detection

## Introduction
Begin by introducing the concept of object detection and its applications in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

## Fundamentals
Introduce the fundamentals of machine learning and explain how object detection models work. 
This can include topics such as supervised learning, feature extraction, and model training.

## Algorithms
Discuss popular object detection algorithms, such as the Viola-Jones algorithm and CNNs.

### Haar cascade
The Viola-Jones algorithm is a popular object detection algorithm that is used to detect objects in images. It was developed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in 2001 and has since been widely used in a variety of applications, including face detection, pedestrian detection, and vehicle detection.

The Viola-Jones algorithm works by training a classifier to detect objects in images by analyzing Haar-like features, which are simple image features that can be used to describe the shape and texture of an object. The classifier is trained on a large dataset of labeled images, and once trained, it can be used to detect objects in new images by sliding a window across the image and evaluating the classifier at each location.

One of the key strengths of the Viola-Jones algorithm is that it is fast and efficient, making it well-suited for real-time object detection tasks. However, it is not as accurate as some more recent object detection algorithms, such as those based on deep learning.
