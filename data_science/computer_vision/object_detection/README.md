# Object Detection

## Introduction
Begin by introducing the concept of object detection and its applications in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

## Fundamentals
Introduce the fundamentals of machine learning and explain how object detection models work. 
This can include topics such as supervised learning, feature extraction, and model training.

## CNN / Haar cascade
Discuss popular object detection algorithms, such as the Viola-Jones algorithm and CNNs.

## Exemples
Walk through an example of training an object detection model using a popular deep learning library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
