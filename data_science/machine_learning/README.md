# Machine Learning
Machine learning is a method of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. It is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

In machine learning, an algorithm is trained on a data set. The algorithm then makes predictions or decisions without being specifically told how to perform the task. The goal is for the algorithm to improve its predictions or decisions over time, as it is exposed to more data.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 

## [Supervised learning](https://github.com/quillaur/data_learning/tree/main/data_science/machine_learning/supervised_learning)
In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled data set, where the correct output is provided for each example in the data set. 

## Unsupervised learning
In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is not provided with labeled training examples, and must find patterns and relationships in the data on its own. 

## [Reinforcement learning](https://github.com/quillaur/data_learning/tree/main/data_science/machine_learning/supervised_learning)
In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties for certain actions.

## Applications
Machine learning has a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, and self-driving cars.
