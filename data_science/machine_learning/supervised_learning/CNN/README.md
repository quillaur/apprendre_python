# Convolutional Neural Network
A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a type of neural network designed for image classification and recognition tasks. It is particularly well suited to processing data with a grid-like topology, such as an image, and is particularly effective at identifying patterns and features in images.

CNNs are composed of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. The layers of a CNN are made up of convolutional layers, activation layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input data, which helps to extract features from the data. The activation layers apply an activation function to the output of the convolutional layers, which helps to introduce nonlinearity into the model. The pooling layers reduce the spatial size of the data, which helps to reduce the computational burden of the model and makes it more robust to small translations in the input data. The fully connected layers combine the features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers and use them to make a prediction.

CNNs have been very successful at a wide range of image classification and recognition tasks and are a key component of many state-of-the-art object detection and image segmentation algorithms.
